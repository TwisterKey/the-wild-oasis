# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

The app starts running : npm run dev

Wild Oasis hotel app: A robust React web app for hotel
management, powered by Supabase. It empowers staff
to handle cabins, bookings, and guests. Developed using
advanced React techniques from "The Ultimate React
Course: React, Redux & More" by Jonas Schmedtmann,
including HOCs, Compound Component Pattern, and
React Query.
